# Metabarcoding analysis of 16S PacBio long-reads of _Alphitobius diaperinus_ gut
This repository contains the R pipeline used to analyze 16S full-length (PacBio) sequencing data of the gut microbiota of *Alphitobius diaperinus*.
Input files can be directy dowloaded from the BioprojectID (PRJNA1330245) and are considered as raw data.

The main results are linked to the manuscript:
"Chemical characterization and gut microbial response unveil polystyrene biodegradation in the lesser mealworm" (in review).  
This README will be updated with citation details upon acceptance.

## Scope
The provided pipeline includes examples for **gut samples**, but can be easily adapted to the other dataset (Instars) with minimal modifications.
